      <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Good Stretch in the software industry over 15 years building software from scratch and scaling it from 1 to 100. I've delved into infrastructure, platform, and data, making them dance together in perfect rhythm. Itâ€™s been a journey filled with learning curves, high-fives, and plenty of caffeine.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've dabbled in AI and ML for the past 5 years, opening doors to a whole new playground. We sprinkled some machine learning magic to make our systems smarter and more intuitive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Getting cozy with AWS and Kubernetes cookie jars, tweaking and tuning to cut down costs and make deployments glide smoother by 25%.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the Cross-Functional Collaboration front, I've bridged gaps between engineering, product, and operations, ensuring seamless project executions and fostering a culture of open communication and collective problem-solving.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a Continuous Improvement Advocate, I initiated a Continuous Improvement culture, reducing system downtimes by 40% through tech lead initiatives (case-sensitive to tech debt) and fostering a learning environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          A quick highlight of my career is my startup, AdvancePay, that I exited earlier this year.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I am someone who not only revels in complex technical challenges but also values the power of teamwork in generating sustainable solutions and driving forward innovation. I am happy to answer any questions as you see fit.
